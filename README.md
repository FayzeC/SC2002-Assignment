# SC2002-Assignment
Added Files that I changed:
1) Added the respective methods for patient, pharmacist, doctor, admin from the AppointmentOutcomeRecordSystem
2) For admin, I only create a view and update func but is up to weihui if she wants to implement them
3) I added the new columns in the AppointmentOutcomeRecords.csv file so should use mine
4) the csv file should be empty (only the headers) unless there is a appointment in appointment.csv that has a COMPLETED status
6) Should have tested for most of the error cases
