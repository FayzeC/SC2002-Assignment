# SC2002-Assignment
Added Files that I changed:
1) CSV Updater - Added a updateCSVCell func that update a cell
2) Added the respective methods for patient, pharmacist, doctor, admin from the AppointmentOutcomeRecordSystem
3) For admin, I only create a view and update func but is up to weihui if she wants to implement them
4) I added the new columns in the AppointmentOutcomeRecords.csv file so should use mine
5) the csv file should be empty (only the headers) unless there is a appointment in appointment.csv that has a COMPLETED status
6) Lastly, I havent test for error case yet
