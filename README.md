# SC2002-Assignment
# Setup Instructions
1. You are recommended to use Intellij with Maven as our project uses it for the bcrypt dependency.
2. Download and unzip the entire github repo (link in Report.pdf) then open it using Intellij
3. Navigate to base package and run the HospitalManagementClass.java to start the program

# Notes
1. Default password for all users is "password". Every user is expected to change to a secure password on first login.
2. To test the functionalities, we recommend you to login as a doctor (ID: D001) first to set availaibility for appointments (option 4 in doctor menu). After that, you can login as a patient (ID: P1001) and schedule an appointment.
3. To restart the testing process, make sure the Appointment_List.csv is completely empty and only leave the header row for Appointment_Outcome_Record.csv
